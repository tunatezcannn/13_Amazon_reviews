I made a two model. 
*1:basic NLP model 
*2:more complex lstm model. 
 I get %90 accuracy in both of them with only using the very small percent of the data. I also get the %89.2 accuracy on the test data in both models
 I didnt play well with the parameters or I didnt try to add or removing some layers because of the colabs gpu problems in my computer. Everytime when I 
 work with a big data even if I batch it the ram is exceed and stop training and also it stops when I use gpus so much. And you also know they are not 
 finish when you use simple cpu in colab. Briefly you can get more and more accurate results if you use more data and train more with only using the same
 models I build.
